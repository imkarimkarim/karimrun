  "brief": "Interested in remote work and open source software. The technologies that I am using in 2022 includes: Next.js, React, Astro, PocketBase and many others. Currently, I am working on a menu maker project (somehow similar to shopify) for restaurants and cafes called coffeeMenu(see my GitHub). It's been about 3-4 years that I amused myself more or less with programming and I got to know more about languages and tools in different fields of technology and finally I chose front-end programming."
