      <h1>Free software movement</h1>

      <hr />

      <p>
        In the realm of technology, few movements have sparked as much debate, innovation, and passion as the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">Free software movement</a>. At its core, it is a crusade for freedom and collaboration, a call to arms for
        programmers and users alike to reclaim control over the software that increasingly shapes our world. The inception of this transformative movement can be traced back to one
        visionary individual: Richard Stallman.

        <br /><br />

        In the 1980s at MIT, Stallman and his associates, a group of interesting people, saw that many programs were being closed off. they didn’t think this was right. they
        believed that everyone should be able to see the program’s code, change it, and share it with others. This idea is what we call “free software.” It’s not about price; it’s
        about having control over and being able to do what you want with the programs you use.

        <br />

        Stallman and his friends started the GNU Project to make a whole system of free software. He also made the Free Software Foundation to support this idea. He wanted to make
        sure that people could always use, share, and change their software freely.

        <br />

        The free software movement is about making sure that software is free in this way. It’s a big idea that has changed how people think about software. It’s not just about
        making programs; it’s about freedom and working together.

        <br /><br />

        This blog will talk more about how the free software movement started, what it has done, and why it’s important. We’ll look at how Stallman’s idea has grown what it means
        for us today and how it affected the world we live in. (and will affect).
